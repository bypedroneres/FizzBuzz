# FizzBuzz

1. The `fizzBuzz` function is defined, which takes an integer `n` as an argument. This function will print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to `n`.

2. A `for` loop is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`. The loop variable `i` represents the current number being processed.

3. Inside the loop, there are conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) to determine what to print for each number `i`.

4. The first condition checks if `i` is a multiple of both 3 and 5. If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., `i % 3 === 0` and `i % 5 === 0`), it prints "FizzBuzz" because it matches both conditions.

5. The second condition checks if `i` is only a multiple of 3 (i.e., `i % 3 === 0`). If it is, it prints "Fizz."

6. The third condition checks if `i` is only a multiple of 5 (i.e., `i % 5 === 0`). If it is, it prints "Buzz."

7. If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., `i` is not divisible by 3, 5, or both), the `else` block is executed, and it prints the current value of `i`.

8. The loop continues to the next number, and the process repeats until it reaches `n`, printing the appropriate output for each number along the way.

This code effectively implements the FizzBuzz logic, which replaces numbers divisible by 3 with "Fizz," numbers divisible by 5 with "Buzz," and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz," while printing all other numbers as-is.
